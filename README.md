**Security Manager:**
	To handle numerous security settings on a Windows PC, this Python application offers a straightforward command-line interface. You can do the following things thanks to it.

**Block USB Ports**: This choice changes the Windows Registry to prevent USB storage devices from operating. As soon as it is run, USB ports will be disabled, making it impossible to use USB flash drives and other USB storage devices.

**Disable Bluetooth:** By selecting this option, the Bluetooth service on the machine is turned off using PowerShell. The execution of this command will stop Bluetooth functioning, preventing Bluetooth devices from connecting.

**Disable Command Prompt:** This option offers instructions for manually turning off the Command Prompt. Unfortunately, a Python script cannot be used to do it straight away. To disable the Command Prompt, kindly refer to the following manual instructions.

**Block website Acess www.facebook.com:** This option alters the system's hosts file to prevent access to the Facebook website. Following the selection of this option, any attempts to visit facebook.com will be routed to a local computer, effectively preventing access to the website.
